# Social Media Botting Example
This is a project written as an example of how political parties and companies can pump out AI content for their campaigns en masse.
Note that this is just an example, and that AI content like this would likely be ineffective in a real campaign (at least I hope).
I don't plan on updating this as it's just a demo, but feel free to use it yourself and expand on it if you wish!
